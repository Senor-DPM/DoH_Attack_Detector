Hello Everyone! I've finally made an ML Prediction Model with 99% accuracy so I have decided to post it here.

DoH (DNS-over-HTTPS) attacks are notorious and not very well-known attacks that have the potential to steal important data or completely ruin a machine.
They can be a malicious website which, if entered, can steal important information like bank details, personal address, etc.
They can also send a lot of malicious requests to one's device, rendering it slow and almost useless towards legitimate requests.

This model factors in various statistics like the "Variance of Packet Length" and "Flow Bytes Received" and can detect if certain DoH traffic is malicious or benign with an accuracy of 99.5%.
